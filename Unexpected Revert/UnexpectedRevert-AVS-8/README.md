## Vulnerable Code

```javascript
 function pay() private {
        //Try to send all the money on contract to the first investors in line
        uint128 money = uint128(address(this).balance);

        //We will do cycle on the queue
        for(uint i=0; i<queue.length; i++){

            uint idx = currentReceiverIndex + i;  //get the index of the currently first investor

            Deposit storage dep = queue[idx]; //get the info of the first investor

            if(money >= dep.expect){  //If we have enough money on the contract to fully pay to investor
                dep.depositor.transfer(dep.expect); //Vulnerable position
                money -= dep.expect;            //update money left

                //this investor is fully paid, so remove him
                delete queue[idx];
            }else{
                //Here we don't have enough money so partially pay to investor
                dep.depositor.transfer(money); //Send to him everything we have
                dep.expect -= money;       //Update the expected amount
                break;                     //Exit cycle
            }

            if(gasleft() <= 50000)         //Check the gas left. If it is low, exit the cycle
                break;                     //The next investor will process the line further
        }
